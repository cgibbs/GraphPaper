TO DO:
-Layers, so that you can show bits of the map at a time. Use Shift + numbers,
and make everything within layers, set to be drawn when enabled. Might be better
to do after OOP Mode Enabled.
-OOP MODE ENABLED: Formally make objects out of drawn objects, 
and put them in master list, to create stack layering for 
everything, instead of static list order.
    --Do this last, save a copy of the refactored code, and see how the speed
	compares between the two. Find out how many objects can be created 
	before speed suffers in a relevant way for both implementations.
