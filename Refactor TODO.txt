TO DO:
-Formally make objects out of drawn objects, and put them in master list, 
    to create stack layering for everything, instead of static list order
    --Do this last, save a copy of the refactored code, and see how the speed
	compares between the two. Find out how many objects can be created 
	before speed suffers in a relevant way for both implementations.
