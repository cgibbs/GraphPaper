---- INTRO ----

This is a graphing tool written in Python by Chance Gibbs. It 
is freely available under the GNU GPLv3. I really don't care 
what you do with/to it, but if you turn it into something nice, 
a little credit would be appreciated. I'm not doing a very 
professional job on this Readme because it's a simple little 
program, and I don't expect anyone to even notice it. Also, 
this is not a professional program, so I'm not going to dress 
it up like one. I wouldn't put on a suit and tie to give you a 
tour of my house, you know?

---- INSTALLATION AND USAGE ----

You can run either gpOriginal.py or gpRefactor.py. But I recommend 
gpRefactor.py.

Requires PyGame.

---- HOW TO DO STUFF ----

It's pretty simple, really. In Line Mode, click somewhere, 
then click somewhere else. Fill Triangle Mode is the same 
way, but with a third click thrown in the mix, and it fills 
in the area inside the three points. Circle Mode is like 
Line Mode, but it draws a filled circle centered at the first
click, with a radius out to the second click. In Write Mode, 
you click to pick a square, and type a letter, and it prints
the letter in the square. In Fill Mode, you just click an area 
between the grey points, and it fills it in. Easy peasy. Also, 
the places you can click include not just the grey points, but 
the middle points between them. Try it out, you'll see what I 
mean.
