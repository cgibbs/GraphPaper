This is a graphing tool written in Python by Chance Gibbs. It is freely availabe under the GNU GPLv3. I really don't care what you do with/to it, but if you turn it into something nice, a little credit would be appreciated. I'm not doing a very professional job on this Readme because it's a simple little program, and I don't expect anyone to even notice it. Also, this is not a professional program, so I'm not going to dress it up like one. I wouldn't put on a suit and tie to give you a tour of my house, you know?

* The one above the Return key. I thought that one
was a forward slash, but Pygame disagrees. I mean, 
I thought the trick was to draw wheels under it, 
and the car faced the direction of the slash? Hmm. 
Anyway, it's the slash above the Return key. 
Whichever one that is.

---- HOW TO DO STUFF ----

It's pretty simple, really. In Line Mode, click somewhere, then click somewhere else. Fill Triangle Mode is the same way, but with a third click thrown in the mix, and it fills in the area inside the three points. Both of these are a tiny bit buggy, and will occasionally draw a line as though you re-selected the last place you clicked. Also, the places you can click include not just the grey points, but the middle points between them. Try it out, you'll see what I mean. In Fill Mode, you just click an area between the grey points, and it fills it in. Easy peasy.
